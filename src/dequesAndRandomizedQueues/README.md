#Programming Assignment 2: Deques and Randomized Queues

Dequeue. A double-ended queue or deque (pronounced "deck") is a generalization of a stack and a queue that supports adding and removing items from either the front or the back of the data structure.

Randomized queue. A randomized queue is similar to a stack or queue, except that the item removed is chosen uniformly at random from items in the data structure.

Permutation client. A client program that takes a command-line integer k; reads in a sequence of strings from standard input using StdIn.readString(); and prints exactly k of them, uniformly at random. Prints each item from the sequence at most once. It is assumed that 0 ≤ k ≤ n, where n is the number of string on standard input.
